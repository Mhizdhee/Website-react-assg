<!-- 2.List five significant features of React -->

1. JSX(JavaScript Syntax Extension)
2. Virtual DOM
3. One-way Data Binding
4. Conditional Statements
5. Components

<!--3. List five major advantages of React
 -->
1. It helps to write less codes and do more.
2.It improved performance.
3.It is declarative.
4.It is composable.
5.Stable Code Structure 

<!-- 4.What is the name of the Software Engineer that created React? Also, which company owns React? -->

It was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at facebook. Facebook/Meta owns React.

<!--5-- What is the notable difference between Html and Jsx? Give atleast 3 of them -->

1.It is possible to write JavaScript directly in Jsx. You can do this by putting the JavaScript in curly braces {...}. Whereas in HTML, you need a script tag or an external JavaScript file to implement JavaScript
2.Tags can self-close in JSX while Self-closing tags in HTML can self-close without the slash before the right angle bracket, that is <br /> could work as <br>.
3.You create a class names as className in Jsx and for attributes for labels you write "HTMLFor" while in Html, class name is written as class.
4.In JSx you write all HTML attributes and event references in camelCase So, onclick becomes onClick, onmouseover becomes onMouseOver while in Html, it is written in small case.

<!--6-- Why can't browsers read JSX -->
Browsers can't read Jsx because JSX is not valid JavaScript, they do not know what to do with it, so we need a transpiler to translate it to React, any file that contains JSX files will be converted into JavaScript objects by Babel transpiler. Thus, browsers understands the code and executes.

























# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
